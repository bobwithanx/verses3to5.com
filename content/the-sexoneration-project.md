							<p>This is the place where shame comes to die.</p>
<p>Many of us carry guilt or embarrassment over sexual experiences&nbsp;in our past. Unfortunately, those feelings can become exacerbated through engrained beliefs and others’ opinions, especially if we are/were part of purity culture.</p>
<p>The Sexoneration Project exists to let you write a letter to your younger self, showing her the grace and unconditional love&nbsp;of God, setting her free from the shackles of shame to become who you are created to be. <strong>Embrace your story, and let our Restorer&nbsp;fill it in a new way to empower&nbsp;you and encourage others.</strong> You are more important than your regrets, and your younger self still&nbsp;needs to hear&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Read <a href="/category/the-sexoneration-project/">others’ letters</a>, and&nbsp;share your own through our <a href="/submission-guidelines/">submission guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><em>“…and the truth will make you free…”</em><br>
<em>John 8:32 (NRSV)</em></p>
