<p>Dear 16-year-old dreamer,</p>
<p>I know you have a burning desire in your heart to do great things. God put that inside of you. He wants you to pursue your vision, but you will find that it will cost you.&nbsp;<span id="more-109"></span>Failures, disappointments, and opposition will cause you to doubt and question your life purpose. Some people that are closest to you will think you’re crazy and foolish. You have so many challenges ahead of you, and you will be tempted to give up countless times. The pressure will eventually cause you to give up if you don’t believe in yourself and trust that God is with you.</p>
<p>Oh dreamer, remember these words of wisdom by James Allen: “You will always gravitate toward that which you, secretly, most love.” It doesn’t matter how old you become, this passion inside you will never die. You may try to suppress it. <strong>What you will find is that life is empty and unfulfilling when you walk away from God’s purpose for you.</strong> And what is worse is to live someone else’s dream. You will spend many years of your life doing just that until God restores you.</p>
<p>Like you, many deny their deepest desires and God-given dreams in order to fulfill what is expected of them by society, a parent, or some other outside influence. Many fall into this trap. Dreamer, I encourage you to stay focused, never give up, be true to yourself, and pursue the dream God has given to you. Do it with faith, determination and no excuses. Be constantly aware that God is with you. He will finish what He has started in you. He goes before and opens the right doors. Trust Him to do things His way. It doesn’t always have to make sense. It will all come together in God’s perfect way and time.</p>
<p>Trust God and BElieve in YOUrself!</p>
<p>With all my heart,</p>
<h6 class="signature">Your Restored and Healed Future Self</h6>
<p>P.S. I think you’ll appreciate these quotes of wisdom and inspiration along with powerful Scriptures that will help you along your journey:</p>
<p>“Always be a first rate version of yourself instead of a second rate version of somebody else.”</p>
<p>-Judy Garland</p>
<p>“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other’s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”</p>
<p>-Steve Jobs</p>
<p>“To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.”</p>
<p>-Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
<p><em>“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”</em></p>
<p>Jeremiah 29:11</p>
<p><em>Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.</em></p>
<p>Philippians 1:6</p>
<p><em>God can do anything, you know—far more than you could ever imagine or guess or request in your wildest dreams! He does it not by pushing us around but by working within us, his Spirit deeply and gently within us.</em></p>
<p>Ephesians 3:20 (MSG)</p>
<p><em>Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires&nbsp;and&nbsp;petitions of your heart.</em></p>
<p>Psalm 37:4 (AMP)</p>
