	<p>Dear 10-year-old Shai,</p>
<p>Hi. &nbsp;ðŸ™‚ Wipe your tears.&nbsp; Itâ€™s not your fault.&nbsp; It never was. &nbsp;<span id="more-131"></span>25 years from now, you will see things much differently.&nbsp; Believe it or not, mom is right about a lot of things concerning you.&nbsp; I was going to write you an eloquent letter with paragraphs, but at this stage in the game, you probably need numbered points for easy reference.&nbsp; I love you so much.&nbsp; Please take my words to heart.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>God loves you more than you could ever imagine</em>.</strong> He really, really, really does.&nbsp; Get to know Him.</li>
<li><strong>Donâ€™t ever second guess yourself.&nbsp;</strong>Stick to your guns, honey.&nbsp; It is so appealing.&nbsp; It will serve you well in life.</li>
<li><strong>You are different.</strong> You always have been.&nbsp; You always will be.&nbsp; And that is perfectly okay.&nbsp; Embrace it. You are smart, you are friggin hilarious (or so people say), you have a lot to offer the world, and&nbsp;<em>God loves you more than you could ever imagine</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Grannie is on to something.</strong> Stop rejecting what sheâ€™s saying about God.&nbsp; You will need this wisdom when she is gone.&nbsp; She is a <em>wealth</em>&nbsp;of knowledge on things of the world and things of God.&nbsp; It doesnâ€™t make sense at 10 years old, but it will.&nbsp; Trust me.</li>
<li><strong>Your dad is off.</strong> He loves you, just in the wrong way.&nbsp; Which leads me to my next point:</li>
<li><strong>Never lose your voice.</strong>&nbsp;<em>No one</em> is a greater advocate for you than you.&nbsp; Donâ€™t ever let anyone belittle you, violate you, make you feel ashamed of who you are, or cause you to doubt.&nbsp; If you are uncomfortable in the company of someone, leave.&nbsp; Call Mom or one of your grandparents to come get you immediately.&nbsp; If someone (<em>anyone</em>) mistreats you, report it. &nbsp;Mom wonâ€™t go to prison for protecting you.&nbsp; She will do what a wise, good mom is supposed to do.</li>
<li><strong>Not everyone is worthy to have a relationship with you.</strong> Even at 10, you are mature enough to determine who should and should not be in your circle.</li>
<li><strong>Donâ€™t be afraid.</strong> Youâ€™re going to fail a lot in life.&nbsp; But itâ€™s the best way to learn.&nbsp; Join the track team.&nbsp; You are a runner, so run.&nbsp; Cheer is fun, but not your calling.&nbsp; Participate versus spectate.&nbsp; Youâ€™re not any of those things that your dad says you are.&nbsp; Heâ€™s sick.&nbsp; Youâ€™re awesome.&nbsp; Any questions? &nbsp;ðŸ™‚</li>
</ol>
<p>Thereâ€™s so much more I want to tell you, but itâ€™s just too soon.&nbsp; Iâ€™ll check back in with you to remind you that life is grand.&nbsp; One day, youâ€™ll be married, have a daughter, and be highly educated.&nbsp; Keep journaling.&nbsp; Keep reading.&nbsp; Keep being a great person.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<h6 class="signature">35-year-old you</h6>
