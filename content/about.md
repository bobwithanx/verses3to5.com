There are a lot of ladies living in you. Throughout the course of your life, you have collected a ragtag bunch who provide running commentary in your head from their own experiences. Maybe there’s the sensitive 5-year-old who always felt left out, or the angry 16-year-old who would do anything to get her parent’s attention. Maybe your story includes a serial-dating 20-something who was desperate for a partner, or maybe she was so career-minded that she completely forgot about relationships of any kind. Or maybe it’s a you from last year whose reality was about to be shifted and her life transformed into something entirely unrecognizable.

Whatever your personal gang looks like, each one could use some advice – and some reassurance – from your present self. No, you don’t have it all figured out, and you probably won’t in a few more years. But these younger you’s could use a note from the future encouraging them or challenging them. And you could use some closure, some healing between you and these gals who were you. Because their trials have helped to produce your character.

We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they are good for us—they help us learn to be patient. And patience develops strength of character in us and helps us trust God more each time we use it until finally our hope and faith are strong and steady. Then, when that happens, we are able to hold our heads high no matter what happens and know that all is well, for we know how dearly God loves us, and we feel this warm love everywhere within us because God has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.

You are drawing closer to the Divine and growing in wisdom each day. You are exactly who needs to write to that child, teen, or woman in your group – what a gift of hope and life to share with her! And she may even have some inspiration to share with you: A forgotten talent, an abandoned interest, an idea never pursued.

Not only that, but your trials, decisions, and life experiences aren’t meant to stay in a vacuum. While giving advice to that younger self, there may be someone who is at the same point in the road who could use your words of encouragement.

<p class="quote">
What a wonderful God we have—he is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the source of every mercy, and the one who so wonderfully comforts and strengthens us in our hardships and trials. And why does he do this? So that when others are troubled, needing our sympathy and encouragement, we can pass on to them this same help and comfort God has given us. You can be sure that the more we undergo sufferings for Christ, the more he will shower us with his comfort and encouragement.

So don’t hoard your wisdom, and don’t hide your shame. Be honest with your story, and in doing so you may be lifting up another sister.
